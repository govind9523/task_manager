A full-featured task management system built with **React** and **React Query** that allows you to easily manage tasks through a simple and intuitive interface. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and real-time data synchronization, making it an ideal tool for organizing your personal or team tasks.

## Features

- 📝 **Create tasks** with title, description, status, and due date
- 👀 **View task details** with quick access to key information
- ✏️ **Edit tasks** and update task information
- 🗑️ **Delete tasks** when no longer needed
- 📅 **Track due dates** for efficient time management
- 📊 **Status management** with customizable task states (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- 🔄 **Real-time data synchronization** for smooth user experience
- 🔒 **User-specific task isolation** to keep tasks private and organized

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js v16+**
- **npm v8+**
- **JSON Server** (for the mock backend, instructions below)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash

### 3. Set up the mock API:
In a separate terminal, start the mock API server using JSON Server:
```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

### 4. Start the development server:

```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`, and you'll be able to interact with the Task Manager UI and the mock API.
